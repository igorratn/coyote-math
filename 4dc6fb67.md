Let ${P_n(x)}_{n=0}^\infty$ be a sequence of monic polynomials defined by the exponential generating function

$$G(x,t)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty P_n(x)\frac{t^n}{n!}=\frac{e^{xt}}{(1-t)^{5/2}}.$$

  

**TRUE or FALSE:**

For every $n\ge 0$, the polynomial $P_n(x)$ satisfies a linear differential equation of the form

$$\alpha(x)P_n^{\prime\prime}(x)+\beta(x)P_n^{\prime}(x)+\gamma_nP_n(x)=0,$$

where $\alpha(x)$ and $\beta(x)$ are polynomials independent of $n$, and $\gamma_n$ is a real constant depending on $n$.

  

Determine, with proof, whether this statement is true or false.

The statement is TRUE.

The sequence of polynomials $P_n(x)$ is defined by the exponential generating function

$G(x,t)=\frac{e^{xt}}{(1-t)^{5/2}}.$

This form of $G(x,t)$ defines a classical orthogonal polynomial family (a Laguerre-type family corresponding to $L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)$ with $\alpha=3/2$, up to scaling).

  

By Bochner’s Theorem, every classical orthogonal polynomial family satisfies a second-order linear differential equation

$\alpha(x)P_n^{\prime\prime}(x)+\beta(x)P_n^{\prime}(x)+\gamma_nP_n(x)=0,$

where $\alpha(x)$ and $\beta(x)$ are polynomials independent of $n$, and $\gamma_n$ depends only on $n$.

  

For this Laguerre-type family the coefficients are

$\alpha(x)=x,$

$\beta(x)=-x+5/2,$

$\gamma_n=n.$

These satisfy all requirements: $\alpha(x)$ and $\beta(x)$ are polynomials independent of $n$, and $\gamma_n$ is a real constant that depends only on $n$.

  

Therefore, the statement is TRUE.
