Determine, with rigorous proof, whether the following statement is true or false for Laguerre polynomials $L_n^\alpha(x)$ on the interval $x \ge 0$ with $\alpha + 1/2 \ge 0$:

There exists a constant $C > 0$ such that for all $n \ge 1$:

$$\sup_{x \ge 0} \Bigl| \frac{x^{\alpha/2 + 1/4} e^{-x/2} L_n^\alpha(x)}{d_n (1 + x^{5/4})} \Bigr| \le C$$

where $d_n^2 = \Gamma(n + \alpha + 1) / n!$.

The statement is true.

Proof

We refer to Nikiforov–Uvarov, Chapter II, Section 7, Equation (27). This source establishes that for $x \ge 0$, the following inequality holds:

$$\frac{x^{\alpha/2 + 1/4} e^{-x/2} |L_n^\alpha(x)|}{d_n} \le \frac{C_2}{n^{1/4}} + \frac{C_3 x^{5/4}}{n^{1/2}}$$

where $C_2$ and $C_3$ depend only on $\alpha$ and are independent of $x$ and $n$. It is explicitly noted that while the standard constraint is $\alpha + 1/2 > 0$, Equation (27) remains valid for the case $\alpha + 1/2 = 0$. 

Dividing both sides of this inequality by $(1 + x^{5/4})$ to match the expression in the statement gives:

$$\Bigl| \frac{x^{\alpha/2 + 1/4} e^{-x/2} L_n^\alpha(x)}{d_n (1 + x^{5/4})} \Bigr| \le \frac{C_2}{n^{1/4}} \frac{1}{1 + x^{5/4}} + \frac{C_3}{n^{1/2}} \frac{x^{5/4}}{1 + x^{5/4}}$$

For all $x \ge 0$, we utilize the following simple bounds:

-   $\frac{1}{1 + x^{5/4}} \le 1$
    
-   $\frac{x^{5/4}}{1 + x^{5/4}} \le 1$
    

Applying these bounds to the inequality for $n \ge 1$:

$$\frac{C_2}{n^{1/4}} \frac{1}{1 + x^{5/4}} + \frac{C_3}{n^{1/2}} \frac{x^{5/4}}{1 + x^{5/4}} \le \frac{C_2}{n^{1/4}} + \frac{C_3}{n^{1/2}} \le C_2 + C_3 \quad (n \ge 1)$$

Let $C = C_2 + C_3$. Because $C_2$ and $C_3$ are constants independent of $n$ and $x$, the sum $C$ is a global constant that satisfies the requirement. Taking the supremum over $x \ge 0$ for all $n \ge 1$ yields:

$$\sup_{x \ge 0} \Bigl| \frac{x^{\alpha/2 + 1/4} e^{-x/2} L_n^\alpha(x)}{d_n (1 + x^{5/4})} \Bigr| \le C$$

The statement is true.
