Determine, with rigorous proof, whether the following statement is true or false for Laguerre polynomials $L_n^\alpha(x)$ on the interval $x \ge 0$ with $\alpha + 1/2 \ge 0$:

Fix $\alpha\ge-1/2$. Then there exists a constant $C(\alpha)>0$ such that for all $n\ge1$:

$$\sup_{x \ge 0} \Bigl| \frac{x^{\alpha/2 + 1/4} e^{-x/2} L_n^\alpha(x)}{d_n (1 + x^{5/4})} \Bigr| \le C(\alpha)$$

where $d_n^2 = \Gamma(n + \alpha + 1) / n!$.

The statement is true.

Proof

Fix $\alpha\ge-1/2$. We refer to A.F. Nikiforov and V.B. Uvarov, Special Functions of Mathematical Physics, Birkhäuser, 1988, Chapter II, §7, their Eq. (27), p.53. For Laguerre polynomials $L_n^\alpha(x)$ and $x\ge0$, this source establishes the inequality

$$\frac{x^{\alpha/2+1/4}e^{-x/2}|L_n^\alpha(x)|}{d_n} \le\frac{C_2}{n^{1/4}}+\frac{C_3x^{5/4}}{n^{1/2}}, \qquad n\ge1,$$

where $d_n^2=\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)/n!$ and the constants $C_2,C_3$ depend only on $\alpha$ and are independent of $x$ and $n$. It is explicitly stated that the Laguerre estimate, originally derived under the assumption $\alpha+1/2>0$, remains valid in the endpoint case $\alpha=-1/2$ (see Nikiforov–Uvarov, Chapter II, §7, p. 53, immediately following their Eq. (27)).

Dividing both sides of this inequality by $1+x^{5/4}$ gives

$$\Bigl|\frac{x^{\alpha/2+1/4}e^{-x/2}L_n^\alpha(x)}{d_n(1+x^{5/4})}\Bigr| \le \frac{C_2}{n^{1/4}}\frac1{1+x^{5/4}} +\frac{C_3}{n^{1/2}}\frac{x^{5/4}}{1+x^{5/4}}.$$

For all $x\ge0$ we have $\frac1{1+x^{5/4}}\le1$ and $\frac{x^{5/4}}{1+x^{5/4}}\le1$. Hence, for $n\ge1$,

$$\Bigl|\frac{x^{\alpha/2+1/4}e^{-x/2}L_n^\alpha(x)}{d_n(1+x^{5/4})}\Bigr| \le \frac{C_2}{n^{1/4}}+\frac{C_3}{n^{1/2}} \le C_2+C_3.$$

Let $C(\alpha)=C_2+C_3$. Since $C_2$ and $C_3$ depend only on $\alpha$, the constant $C(\alpha)$ is independent of $x$ and $n$. Taking the supremum over $x\ge0$ yields

$$\sup_{x\ge0}\Bigl|\frac{x^{\alpha/2+1/4}e^{-x/2}L_n^\alpha(x)}{d_n(1+x^{5/4})}\Bigr| \le C(\alpha), \qquad n\ge1.$$

Therefore, for this fixed $\alpha\ge-1/2$, the stated bound holds.
