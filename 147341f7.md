Let $p_n(x)$ be the monic Legendre polynomials on $[-1,1]$ orthogonal with respect to $\rho(x)=1$. Fix $a>1$. Let $q_n(z)$ be the function of the second kind defined for $z \notin [-1,1]$ by:

$$q_n(z) = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{p_n(t)}{z-t} dt$$

Define a modified sequence of functions $\{\bar q_n(z)\}_{n \ge 1}$ by the identity:

$$\bar q_n(z) = D_n(q_n(z) p_{n-1}(a) - q_{n-1}(z) p_n(a))$$

where $D_n$ is a normalization constant.

**Claim:** For every $n \ge 1$, the value of this second-kind combination evaluated at the pole $z=a$ satisfies $\bar q_n(a) = \frac{D_n}{n}$.

Determine, with rigorous proof, whether the claim is **True or False**.

The claim is false.

Substituting $z=a$ into the definition gives

$$\bar q_n(a)=D_n(q_n(a)p_{n-1}(a)-q_{n-1}(a)p_n(a)).$$

Define

$$W_n(z)=q_n(z)p_{n-1}(z)-q_{n-1}(z)p_n(z).$$

Then

$$\bar q_n(a)=D_nW_n(a).$$

We can write $W_n$ as a single integral:

$$W_n(z)=\int_{-1}^1\frac{p_n(t)p_{n-1}(z)-p_{n-1}(t)p_n(z)}{z-t}dt.$$

For fixed $t$, the numerator is a polynomial in $z$ that vanishes at $z=t$, hence is divisible by $z-t$. The quotient is therefore a polynomial in $z$ of degree at most $n-1$. Its coefficients depend continuously on $t$, so integration over $t \in [-1,1]$ preserves polynomial dependence in $z$. Thus $W_n(z)$ is a polynomial in $z$ of degree at most $n-1$.

To identify this polynomial, compute its limit as $z \to \infty$. For $|z|>1$,

$$\frac{1}{z-t}=\sum_{k\ge0}\frac{t^k}{z^{k+1}},$$

and this series converges uniformly for $t \in [-1,1]$, allowing interchange of sum and integral:

$$q_n(z)=\sum_{k\ge0}\frac{1}{z^{k+1}}\int_{-1}^1 t^k p_n(t)dt.$$

Since $p_n$ is orthogonal to all polynomials of degree $<n$,

$$\int_{-1}^1 t^k p_n(t)dt=0 \quad (k<n).$$

Because $p_n$ is monic, $t^n-p_n(t)$ has degree $<n$ and is orthogonal to $p_n$, so

$$\int_{-1}^1 t^n p_n(t)dt=\int_{-1}^1 p_n(t)^2dt=h_n.$$

Hence

$$q_n(z)=\frac{h_n}{z^{n+1}}+O(z^{-(n+2)}), \qquad q_{n-1}(z)=\frac{h_{n-1}}{z^n}+O(z^{-(n+1)}).$$

By monicity,

$$p_n(z)=z^n+O(z^{n-1}), \qquad p_{n-1}(z)=z^{n-1}+O(z^{n-2}).$$

Substituting into $W_n(z)=q_n(z)p_{n-1}(z)-q_{n-1}(z)p_n(z)$ gives

$$W_n(z)=-h_{n-1}+O(z^{-1}).$$

Thus $\lim_{z \to \infty}W_n(z)=-h_{n-1}$ is finite. Since $W_n$ is a polynomial with a finite limit as $z \to \infty$, it must be constant:

$$W_n(z) \equiv -h_{n-1}.$$

Evaluating at $z=a$,

$$\bar q_n(a)=D_nW_n(a)=-D_nh_{n-1}=-D_n\int_{-1}^1 p_{n-1}(t)^2dt.$$

For $n=1$, $h_0=\int_{-1}^1 1^2dt=2$, so $\bar q_1(a)=-2D_1$. The claim would require $\bar q_1(a)=D_1$, forcing $D_1=0$, which contradicts that $D_n \neq 0$ is a normalization constant.

Final Answer: False.
