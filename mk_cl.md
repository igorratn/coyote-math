I have a file called all.md that contains multiple math problem entries, each identified by a header "### File: [filename].md".

Please perform a comprehensive, fine-grained clustering of all problems found in the file based on their mathematical methodology. Follow these instructions strictly:



Dynamic Discovery: Do not assume the number of files. Scan the entire all.md file to discover and extract every unique filename associated with a "### File:" header. List every single file found; do not truncate the list.

Fine-Grained Sub-clustering: Group the files into broad methodology clusters, then break those down into small, highly specific sub-clusters.

Cluster Statistics: Include the total number of files contained within each main cluster and sub-cluster.

Descriptions: For each sub-cluster, provide a full, detailed description of one typical file as an example. For all other files in that cluster, provide a brief one-sentence description of the specific problem or claim.

Complete Linking: For every single file, provide a link to the repository: filename.md.
