Consider the physicists’ Hermite polynomials $H_n(x)$ on $(-\infty,\infty)$ with $n\ge1$, and define $x^*=0$. Question: Determine whether the following claim is true or false, and justify your answer with a rigorous proof: As $|x|$ increases, the successive local maxima of $|H_n(x)|$ strictly increase for all $x$.

The claim is TRUE.

Let $y(x) = H_n(x)$. As shown in A.F. Nikiforov and V.B. Uvarov, Special Functions of Mathematical Physics (1988), Chapter 2, Section 7, solutions of hypergeometric-type equations admit the auxiliary function

$$v(x) = y(x)^2 + \lambda_n^{-1}\sigma(x)y'(x)^2$$

whose values at the local maxima of $|y|$ coincide with $|y(x)|^2$, since $y'(x) = 0$ at those points.

For physicists' Hermite polynomials $H_n(x)$, the differential equation has parameters $\sigma(x) = 1$, $\tau(x) = -2x$, and $\lambda_n = 2n$. Differentiation yields (NU, Eq. (6))

$$v'(x) = \frac{\sigma'(x) - 2\tau(x)}{\lambda_n} y'(x)^2$$

Since $(y'(x))^2\ge0$ everywhere and $\lambda_n>0$,  the monotonicity of the successive maxima of $|y|$ is governed by the sign of the linear factor $\sigma'(x) - 2\tau(x)$.

For the Hermite case,

$$\sigma'(x)-2\tau(x)=4x$$

which changes sign at $x^*=0$. Hence $v'(x) \le 0$ on $(-\infty,0)$ and $v'(x) \ge 0$ on $(0,\infty)$.

Since $y'(x)=H_n'(x)=2nH_{n-1}(x)$ is a nonzero polynomial, it cannot vanish identically on any interval, so $v'(x)$ does not vanish identically on any subinterval; therefore $v$ is strictly decreasing on $(-\infty,0)$ and strictly increasing on $(0,\infty)$.

Therefore, as $|x|$ increases, the successive local maxima of $|H_n(x)|$ strictly increase for all $n \ge 1$.

Final Answer: TRUE.
