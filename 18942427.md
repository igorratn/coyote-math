Consider the physicists’ Hermite polynomials $H_n(x)$ on $(-\infty,\infty)$ with $n\ge1$, and define $x^*=0$.

Question: Determine whether the following claim is true or false, and justify your answer with a rigorous proof:

As $|x|$ increases, the successive local maxima of $|H_n(x)|$ strictly increase for all $x$.

The claim is true for physicists' Hermite polynomials $H_n(x)$ with $n \ge 1$.

Let $y(x) = H_n(x)$. Then $y$ satisfies the differential equation

$$y''(x) - 2xy'(x) + 2ny(x) = 0$$

which is of hypergeometric type $\sigma y'' + \tau y' + \lambda y = 0$ with $\sigma(x) = 1$, $\tau(x) = -2x$, and $\lambda = \lambda_n = 2n$. Following the Nikiforov–Uvarov extremum method (A.F. Nikiforov and V.B. Uvarov, Special Functions of Mathematical Physics, 1988, Chapter 2, Section 7, Equations (5)–(6)), we define the auxiliary function

$$v(x) = y(x)^2 + \lambda^{-1}\sigma(x)(y'(x))^2 = y(x)^2 + \frac{1}{2n}(y'(x))^2$$

At any local maximum point $x_k$ of $|y|$ (equivalently of $y^2$), we have $y'(x_k) = 0$, hence $v(x_k) = y(x_k)^2 = |y(x_k)|^2$. Differentiating $v$ and substituting the differential equation gives (NU, Eq. (6))

$$v'(x) = \frac{\sigma'(x) - 2\tau(x)}{\lambda}(y'(x))^2 = \frac{0 - 2(-2x)}{2n}(y'(x))^2 = \frac{x}{n}(y'(x))^2$$

Because $(y'(x))^2 > 0$ on any open interval between consecutive zeros of $y'$, the derivative $v'(x)$ has a fixed nonzero sign on such intervals. This ensures strict monotonicity between consecutive critical points. Thus $v'(x) > 0$ for $x > 0$ and $v'(x) < 0$ for $x < 0$. Therefore, the values $v(x_k) = |y(x_k)|^2$ at successive local maxima increase as $x$ increases on $(0, \infty)$, and also increase as $x$ decreases on $(-\infty, 0)$. Equivalently, as $|x|$ increases away from 0, the successive local maxima of $|H_n(x)|$ strictly increase.

(For $n = 0$, $H_0(x) = 1$ has no nontrivial sequence of local maxima.)

Final Answer: TRUE.
