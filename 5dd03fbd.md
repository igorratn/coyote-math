Let $\{L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)\}$ denote the **Generalized Laguerre Polynomials**, orthogonal on $[0, \infty)$ with respect to the weight $p(x) = x^\alpha e^{-x}$.

A new system of polynomials, $\{\tilde{L}_n^{(\alpha)}(x)\}$, is constructed to be orthogonal on $[0, \infty)$ with respect to the modified weight $\tilde{p}(x) = x^{\alpha+1} e^{-x}$.

The new polynomials are related to the standard polynomials by the identity (a special case of a derivative-based transformation):

$$\tilde{L}_n^{(\alpha)}(x) = L_{n}^{(\alpha)}(x) + \delta_n L_{n-1}^{(\alpha+1)}(x)$$

The identity is known to preserve the degree: $\deg(\tilde{L}_n^{(\alpha)}) = n$.


Determine whether the following claim is **True or False**, and give a rigorous proof of your conclusion:

To determine the unknown coefficient $\delta_n$ for any $n \ge 1$, the necessary orthogonality condition is $(\tilde{L}_n^{(\alpha)}, L_{n-1}^{(\alpha+1)})_{\tilde{p}} = 0$.

The claim is True.

Claim: The necessary orthogonality condition to determine $\delta_n$ in $\tilde L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)=L_n^{(\alpha)}(x)+\delta_nL_{n-1}^{(\alpha+1)}(x)$ is $(\tilde L_n^{(\alpha)},L_{n-1}^{(\alpha+1)})_{\tilde p}=0$, where $(f,g)_{\tilde p}=\int_0^\infty f(x)g(x)x^{\alpha+1}e^{-x}dx$.

Since ${\tilde L_n^{(\alpha)}}$ is orthogonal with respect to $\tilde p$ and the transformation preserves degree, $\deg(\tilde L_n^{(\alpha)})=n$. For a positive weight, an orthogonal polynomial of degree n is orthogonal (in the same inner product) to every polynomial of degree strictly less than n. Because $\deg(L_{n-1}^{(\alpha+1)})=n-1<n$, it follows that $(\tilde L_n^{(\alpha)},L_{n-1}^{(\alpha+1)})_{\tilde p}=0$. This proves the claim.

Final answer: True.
