In the $(u,v)$-chart of a surface with metric $ds^{2} = du^{2} + \sinh^{2}u\,dv^{2}$, the marked point $P$ lies on the curve indicated in the figure (with its orientation shown by the arrow). At $P$ it is given that $\sinh u = \tfrac{4}{3}$. Compute the signed geodesic curvature $k_g$ at $P$ of this curve. Give your final answer as an exact number (no decimals).


Step 1. Work on the surface with metric $ds^{2}=du^{2}+\sinh^{2}u\,dv^{2}$.  
The curve is $u=\text{const}$. From the figure, the arrow shows a clockwise traversal, i.e.\ $v$ is decreasing.

Step 2. In orthogonal coordinates with $F=0$, the geodesic curvature of a $v$â€“curve ($u=\text{const}$) has magnitude  
$\lvert k_g\rvert \;=\;\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{EG}}\,\partial_u(\sqrt{G}) \;=\;\tfrac{1}{\sinh u}\,\partial_u(\sinh u)\;=\;\coth u$.  
Because the curve is oriented by decreasing $v$ (clockwise), the signed value is $k_g=-\coth u$.

Step 3. At $P$, $\sinh u=\tfrac{4}{3}$. Using $\cosh^{2}u-\sinh^{2}u=1$ gives  
$\cosh u=\sqrt{1+\left(\tfrac{4}{3}\right)^{2}}=\tfrac{5}{3}$. Hence  
$k_g=-\dfrac{\cosh u}{\sinh u}=-\tfrac{5}{4}$.

Final answer: $\,-\dfrac{5}{4}$.
