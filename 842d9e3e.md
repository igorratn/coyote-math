Let $Y_{\ell m}(\mathbf{n})$ be the spherical harmonics of order $\ell$ defined on the unit sphere, where $\mathbf{n}$ is a unit vector. The addition theorem states that for any two unit vectors $\mathbf{n}_1$ and $\mathbf{n}_2$, the Legendre polynomial of the cosine of the angle $\gamma$ between them satisfies

$$P_\ell(\mathbf{n}_1 \cdot \mathbf{n}_2) = \frac{4\pi}{2\ell+1} \sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} Y_{\ell m}(\mathbf{n}_1) Y_{\ell m}^*(\mathbf{n}_2)$$

Define a linear operator $T_\ell$ acting on the space of square-integrable functions $L^2(S^2)$ such that for any function $f(\mathbf{n})$,

$$(T_\ell f)(\mathbf{n}_1) = \int_{S^2} P_\ell(\mathbf{n}_1 \cdot \mathbf{n}_2) f(\mathbf{n}_2) d\Omega_2$$

Claim: The operator $T_\ell$ is a projection operator onto the subspace spanned by the spherical harmonics of order $\ell$, multiplied by the constant factor $\frac{4\pi}{2\ell+1}$.

Determine with rigorous proof whether the claim is True or False.

Conclusion: True.

By substituting the addition theorem into the definition of the operator $T_\ell$, the action of the operator on a function $f$ is expressed as

$$(T_\ell f)(\mathbf{n}_1) = \int_{S^2} \left[ \frac{4\pi}{2\ell+1} \sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} Y_{\ell m}(\mathbf{n}_1) Y_{\ell m}^*(\mathbf{n}_2) \right] f(\mathbf{n}_2) d\Omega_2$$

Since the sum is finite, the order of summation and integration can be interchanged, leading to

$$(T_\ell f)(\mathbf{n}_1) = \frac{4\pi}{2\ell+1} \sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} Y_{\ell m}(\mathbf{n}_1) \int_{S^2} Y_{\ell m}^*(\mathbf{n}_2) f(\mathbf{n}_2) d\Omega_2$$

The integral $\int_{S^2} Y_{\ell m}^*(\mathbf{n}_2) f(\mathbf{n}_2) d\Omega_2$ equals the expansion coefficient $a_{\ell m}$ in the $L^2(S^2)$-orthonormal basis ${Y_{\ell m}}$. The result becomes

$$(T_\ell f)(\mathbf{n}_1) = \frac{4\pi}{2\ell+1} \sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} a_{\ell m} Y_{\ell m}(\mathbf{n}_1)$$

Because the spherical harmonics of different orders are orthogonal, the sum $\sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} a_{\ell m} Y_{\ell m}$ is the orthogonal projection of $f$ onto the subspace $\mathcal{H}_\ell$ of harmonics of degree $\ell$. Let $P_\ell$ denote the orthogonal projection onto $\mathcal{H}_\ell$. Then $T_\ell = \frac{4\pi}{2\ell+1} P_\ell$, which means $T_\ell$ acts as the scalar multiple $\frac{4\pi}{2\ell+1}$ times the identity on $\mathcal{H}_\ell$, and as the zero operator on all other subspaces $\mathcal{H}_k$ where $k \neq \ell$. This confirms that the kernel of the addition theorem acts as a scaled projection operator, a foundational property of the rotation group representation on the sphere.
