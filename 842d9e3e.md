Let $d_{mm'}^\ell(\beta)$ denote the reduced Wigner D-function defined for degree $\ell$ and orders $m, m'$ with $|m|, |m'| \le \ell$. Define the bilinear form $B_\ell: \mathbb{R}^{2\ell+1} \times \mathbb{R}^{2\ell+1} \to \mathbb{R}$ by

$$B_\ell(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}) = \int_0^\pi \left[\sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} u_m d_{m0}^\ell(\beta)\right] \left[\sum_{m'=-\ell}^{\ell} v_{m'} d_{m'0}^\ell(\beta)\right] \sin\beta \, d\beta$$

where $\mathbf{u} = (u_{-\ell}, \ldots, u_\ell)$ and $\mathbf{v} = (v_{-\ell}, \ldots, v_\ell)$ are real vectors. For fixed $\ell \ge 1$, consider the quadratic form $Q_\ell(\mathbf{u}) = B_\ell(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{u})$.

Claim

For every $\ell \ge 1$, the quadratic form $Q_\ell$ is positive definite on $\mathbb{R}^{2\ell+1}$. That is, $Q_\ell(\mathbf{u}) > 0$ for all nonzero vectors $\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{R}^{2\ell+1}$.

Question

Determine with rigorous proof whether the claim is True or False.

Conclusion False

For real $\beta$ and $m'=0$, the reduced Wigner functions $d_{m0}^\ell(\beta)$ are real, so the quadratic form is

$$Q_\ell(\mathbf u)=\int_0^\pi\left(\sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell}u_m d_{m0}^\ell(\beta)\right)^2\sin\beta \, d\beta\ge 0$$

The symmetry of Wigner D-functions is given by $d_{-m,-m'}^\ell(\beta)=(-1)^{m-m'}d_{mm'}^\ell(\beta)$. For the case $m'=0$, this relation simplifies to $d_{-m,0}^\ell(\beta)=(-1)^m d_{m0}^\ell(\beta)$.

Grouping the sum $f_{\mathbf u}(\beta) = \sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} u_m d_{m0}^\ell(\beta)$ in pairs of $m$ and $-m$ for $m \ge 1$ yields

$$u_m d_{m0}^\ell(\beta)+u_{-m}d_{-m,0}^\ell(\beta) = \left(u_m+(-1)^m u_{-m}\right)d_{m0}^\ell(\beta)$$

The total sum can then be written as

$$f_{\mathbf u}(\beta) = u_0 d_{00}^\ell(\beta) + \sum_{m=1}^{\ell} \left(u_m + (-1)^m u_{-m}\right) d_{m0}^\ell(\beta)$$

This expression shows that $f_{\mathbf u}(\beta)$ depends only on at most $\ell + 1$ linear combinations of the $2\ell + 1$ components of $\mathbf{u}$. To prove $Q_\ell$ is not positive definite, choose a nonzero vector $\mathbf{u}$ that nullifies these combinations. For any fixed $\ell \ge 1$, pick $m$ such that $1 \le m \le \ell$ and set

$$u_m = 1, \quad u_{-m} = (-1)^{m+1}, \quad u_j = 0 \text{ for } j \ne \pm m$$

Calculating the relevant coefficient for this vector gives

$$u_m + (-1)^m u_{-m} = 1 + (-1)^m(-1)^{m+1} = 1 - 1 = 0$$

Because all other $u_j$ are zero (including $u_0$), it follows that $f_{\mathbf u}(\beta) \equiv 0$ for all $\beta \in [0, \pi]$. Consequently, $Q_\ell(\mathbf u) = \int_0^\pi 0 \cdot \sin\beta \, d\beta = 0$ for a nonzero vector $\mathbf{u}$.

Since there exists a nonzero $\mathbf{u}$ for which $Q_\ell(\mathbf{u}) = 0$, the quadratic form is positive semidefinite but not positive definite.
