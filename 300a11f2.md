Let $J_\nu(z)$ denote the Bessel function of the first kind of order $\nu$, satisfying the differential equation

$$z^2 u'' + zu' + (z^2 - \nu^2)u = 0.$$

Consider the modified Bessel equation:

$$z^2 v'' + zv' - (z^2 + \nu^2)v = 0.$$

For $\nu \geq 0$, define the modified Bessel functions (using the principal branch):

$$I_\nu(z) = e^{-i\pi\nu/2} J_\nu(iz), \quad K_\nu(z) = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{I_{-\nu}(z) - I_\nu(z)}{\sin(\pi\nu)}.$$

Claim: For non-integer $\nu > 0$, the pair ${I_\nu(z), I_{-\nu}(z)}$ forms a complete basis for solutions of the modified Bessel equation on $\mathbb{C} \setminus {0}$, and therefore $K_\nu(z)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of $I_\nu$ and $I_{-\nu}$ on this domain.

Determine whether this claim is True or False, and give a rigorous proof of your conclusion.

Claim : True.

Fix a non-integer $\nu > 0$. The modified Bessel equation

$$z^2v'' + zv' - (z^2 + \nu^2)v = 0$$

has a regular singular point at $z = 0$ and is analytic on $\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$. On any simply connected domain $D \subset \mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$ where a single branch of $z^\nu$ is fixed (principal branch), the local Frobenius exponents at $0$ are $\pm\nu$. Thus, there exist solutions with leading behaviors $z^\nu$ and $z^{-\nu}$.

With the standard definitions, $I_\nu(z)$ and $I_{-\nu}(z)$ are solutions on $D$. Their Wronskian satisfies the relation $W' = -\frac{1}{z}W$, which implies $W(z) = \frac{C}{z}$. Using the known value of the constant for modified Bessel functions:

$$W[I_\nu, I_{-\nu}](z) = -\frac{2\sin(\pi\nu)}{\pi z}$$

This Wronskian is nonzero for non-integer $\nu$. Therefore, $I_\nu$ and $I_{-\nu}$ are linearly independent on $D$, forming a fundamental set of solutions; consequently, every solution is a linear combination of them.

By the given definition:

$$K_\nu(z) = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{I_{-\nu}(z) - I_\nu(z)}{\sin(\pi\nu)} = \frac{\pi}{2\sin(\pi\nu)}I_{-\nu}(z) - \frac{\pi}{2\sin(\pi\nu)}I_\nu(z)$$

Thus, $K_\nu$ is explicitly a linear combination of $I_\nu$ and $I_{-\nu}$ on $D$. Since $D$ was an arbitrary simply connected subdomain of $\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}$ compatible with the chosen branch, the claim follows.
