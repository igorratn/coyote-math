Got it üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs a summary of this chat so you can pick up smoothly in a new thread:

‚∏ª

Context
	‚Ä¢	You are working with differential geometry exercises (based on –ü–æ–∑–Ω—è–∫ & –®–∏–∫–∏–Ω, –î–∏—Ñ—Ñ–µ—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –≥–µ–æ–º–µ—Ç—Ä–∏—è: –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–µ –∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–º—Å—Ç–≤–æ).
	‚Ä¢	You want to create image-based prompts where all information is contained in the image, so the model must reason using the picture ‚Äî not just text.
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôve already practiced with paraboloid, saddle, and sphere surfaces, deriving geodesic curvature, normal curvature, and geodesic torsion of intersection curves at marked points.
	‚Ä¢	The workflow:
	1.	Start with a labeled image (surface, plane, marked point).
	2.	Write a clear prompt tied only to what is in the image.
	3.	Provide a step-by-step solution in human-like style (with inline KaTeX).
	4.	Ensure the final answer has a specific, objective format (e.g., simplified fractional form, or fractional triplet).
	‚Ä¢	You are now moving toward Chapter 4 (Riemannian geometry/tensors) and want prompts that use the Riemannian metric framework directly, not Darboux/frame methods only.
	‚Ä¢	A recent attempt: generate an image of a geodesic triangle in the Poincar√© disk. The first drafts were messy; you want clear, consistent labels, points, and arcs.

Key Requirements
	1.	Image design
	‚Ä¢	Must contain all necessary information (surface equation, plane, marked point, curve, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Labels should be consistent, same size, clearly placed.
	‚Ä¢	No extraneous or confusing symbols.
	‚Ä¢	Minimal ticks, colors, but clearly visible geometry.
	2.	Prompts
	‚Ä¢	Example:
‚ÄúIn the attached image, determine the geodesic curvature, the normal curvature, and the geodesic torsion of the intersection curve at the marked point P. Give your final answer as a simplified fractional triplet.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Must rely entirely on the image (no hidden text assumptions).
	‚Ä¢	Final answer format should be specified clearly.
	3.	Solutions
	‚Ä¢	Human-like explanation, step-by-step.
	‚Ä¢	Use inline KaTeX only (e.g., $x^2$, not $$x^2$$).
	‚Ä¢	Avoid double commas.
	‚Ä¢	Include double-check step if possible.
	‚Ä¢	Tie steps to book chapters when relevant.

Where You Left Off
	‚Ä¢	You requested a clean re-draw of the Poincar√© disk geodesic triangle (points O, P, Q marked, arcs visible, labels consistent).
	‚Ä¢	You want to connect this with Chapter 4 (Riemann geometry) by designing a prompt that forces reasoning using the metric, not just surface/curve formulas.
	‚Ä¢	Next step: finalize the clean image and then draft a prompt + solution based on Riemannian metric reasoning.

üëâ Would you like me to carry forward by drafting a new image-based prompt in Riemannian geometry (using the clean Poincar√© disk triangle) and then solve it step by step, or do you prefer I first refine the image itself further?
