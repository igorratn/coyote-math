Consider the quantum harmonic oscillator orthonormal basis

$$\psi_n(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\sqrt{\pi}2^nn!}}e^{-x^2/2}H_n(x).$$

Let

$$g(x)=(x^2+1)e^{-x^2}.$$

Claim: in the expansion

$$g(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\psi_n(x),$$

only finitely many coefficients are nonzero, and moreover $a_n=0$ for all $n\ge4$.

Determine whether the claim is true or false and justify your answer rigorously.


claim false.

to justify this rigorously, we examine the expansion coefficients $a_n$ and the structure of the finite span of the basis $\{\psi_n\}$.

the function $g(x) = (x^2+1)e^{-x^2}$ is even. the basis functions $\psi_n$ have parity $\psi_n(-x)=(-1)^n\psi_n(x)$. the coefficient $a_n$ is given by the integral $a_n=\langle g,\psi_n\rangle=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(x)\psi_n(x)dx$. whenever $n$ is odd, the integrand is the product of an even function and an odd function, hence is odd, so $a_n=0$ for all odd $n$.

if $g$ were a finite linear combination of $\psi_0, \dots, \psi_N$, then $g(x) = e^{-x^2/2} P_N(x)$ where $P_N$ is a polynomial of degree at most $N$. this follows because each $\psi_n(x)$ equals $e^{-x^2/2}$ times a degree-$n$ polynomial, and finite sums of polynomials remain polynomials. for the claim to be true, $g$ would have to equal such a product for some $N$, and specifically for $N=3$ given the claim $a_n=0$ for all $n \ge 4$.

we test this condition by multiplying $g(x)$ by $e^{x^2/2}$:

$$g(x)e^{x^2/2}=(x^2+1)e^{-x^2/2}.$$

this function is not identically zero and it decays to $0$ as $|x|\to\infty$, so it is bounded on $\mathbb{R}$. since any nonzero polynomial is unbounded on $\mathbb{R}$, this function is not a polynomial.

hence no such $N$ exists. therefore $g$ cannot lie in the finite-dimensional span of $\{\psi_0, \dots, \psi_N\}$ for any $N$. the expansion cannot terminate, which directly contradicts the claim that only finitely many coefficients are nonzero and that $a_n=0$ for all $n \ge 4$.
