Lommel's equation is given by

$$z^2 u'' + zu' + (z^2 - \nu^2)u = z^{s+1}$$

where $\nu, s \in \mathbb{R}$ are parameters. This inhomogeneous equation has solutions of the form

$$u(z) = A J_\nu(z) + B Y_\nu(z) + u_p(z)$$

where $J_\nu$, $Y_\nu$ are Bessel functions of the first and second kind, and $u_p(z)$ is a particular solution.

For the case $s = \nu + 2n$ where $n \geq 1$ is an integer, a particular solution has the asymptotic expansion as $z \to \infty$:

$$u_p(z) \sim z^{\nu+2n-1} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k z^{-2k}$$

where the coefficients $a_k$ are determined by substitution into the differential equation.

Claim: For all $\nu > -1$ and $n \geq 1$, the particular solution $u_p(z)$ satisfies the bound

$$|u_p(z)| \leq C z^{\nu+2n-1}$$

for all sufficiently large $z \geq z_0$.

Determine whether this claim is True or False, and give a rigorous proof of your conclusion.

The claim is true

Proof:

Set $\alpha=\nu+2n-1$. Since $\nu>-1$ and $n\ge1$, one has $\alpha>0$.

Let $u_p$ be a particular solution with the given asymptotic expansion

$$u_p(z)\sim z^\alpha\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k z^{-2k}\qquad(z\to\infty).$$

By definition of asymptotic expansion, the $k=0$ truncation gives

$$u_p(z)=z^\alpha\bigl(a_0+o(1)\bigr)\qquad(z\to\infty).$$

Hence there exists $z_0\ge1$ such that for all $z\ge z_0$ one has $|o(1)|\le1$, so

$$|u_p(z)|\le z^\alpha\bigl(|a_0|+1\bigr)\qquad(z\ge z_0).$$

This proves the claimed bound for $u_p$ with $C=|a_0|+1$.

If $\tilde u_p$ is another particular solution, then $\tilde u_p-u_p$ solves the homogeneous Bessel equation, so $\tilde u_p=u_p+AJ_\nu+BY_\nu$. Using $J_\nu(z)=O(z^{-1/2})$ and $Y_\nu(z)=O(z^{-1/2})$ as $z\to\infty$, there are constants $C_1,C_2$ such that for $z\ge z_0$,

$$|\tilde u_p(z)|\le C_1 z^\alpha+C_2 z^{-1/2}.$$

Since $\alpha>0$, enlarge $z_0$ so that $z^{-1/2}\le z^\alpha$ for all $z\ge z_0$, which gives

$$|\tilde u_p(z)|\le (C_1+C_2)z^\alpha\qquad(z\ge z_0).$$

Any other particular solution differs by a homogeneous solution, so it still satisfies the same growth bound for large $z$.

Therefore the claim is true.
