Let $p_n(x)_{n\ge0}$ be the monic orthogonal polynomials with respect to a positive weight $\rho(x)$ supported on an interval $I\subset\mathbb R$.

Assume that $\beta_1\in\mathbb R\setminus I$ and $\alpha_1\in\mathbb R$ are fixed.

Define a modified weight

$$\bar\rho(x)=\frac{x-\alpha_1}{x-\beta_1}\rho(x).$$

Suppose that for each $n\ge1$ there exist constants $A_n,B_n$ such that the function

$$\bar p_n(x)=\frac{1}{x-\alpha_1}\bigl(p_{n+1}(x)+A_n p_n(x)+B_n p_{n-1}(x)\bigr)$$

is a polynomial.

Claim: For every $n\ge1$, the polynomials $\bar p_n(x)$ are monic of degree $n$ and form an orthogonal system with respect to the weight $\bar\rho(x)$.

Determine, with proof, whether the claim is true or false.

The claim is False.

The condition that $\bar{p}_n(x)$ is a polynomial ensures that $A_n$ and $B_n$ satisfy a specific linear relationship, but it does not satisfy the requirements of orthogonality.

Proof

1.  Degree and Monicity
    
    If $\bar{p}_n(x) = \frac{1}{x-\alpha_1}(p_{n+1}(x) + A_n p_n(x) + B_n p_{n-1}(x))$ is a polynomial, the numerator $Q_n(x) = p_{n+1}(x) + A_n p_n(x) + B_n p_{n-1}(x)$ must vanish at $x = \alpha_1$. Because $p_{n+1}$ is a monic polynomial of degree $n+1$, the quotient $\bar{p}_n(x)$ is a monic polynomial of degree $n$.
    
2.  The Orthogonality Requirement
    
    For $\bar{p}_n(x)$ to be orthogonal with respect to $\bar{\rho}(x)$, it must satisfy $\int_I \bar{p}_n(x) \pi_{n-1}(x) \bar{\rho}(x) dx = 0$ for any polynomial $\pi_{n-1}(x)$ of degree less than $n$. Substituting the definitions of the modified weight and the polynomial:
    
    $$\int_I \frac{Q_n(x)}{x-\alpha_1} \pi_{n-1}(x) \frac{x-\alpha_1}{x-\beta_1} \rho(x) dx = \int_I \frac{Q_n(x) \pi_{n-1}(x)}{x-\beta_1} \rho(x) dx = 0$$
    

Using the decomposition $\frac{\pi_{n-1}(x)}{x - \beta_1} = s(x) + \frac{\pi_{n-1}(\beta_1)}{x - \beta_1}$, where $s(x)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n-2$, the integral becomes:

$$\int_I Q_n(x) s(x) \rho(x) dx + \pi_{n-1}(\beta_1) \int_I \frac{Q_n(x)}{x - \beta_1} \rho(x) dx = 0$$

The first term is zero by the orthogonality of the original polynomials. The second term vanishes if and only if $Q_n(x)$ satisfies the pole condition:

$$q_{n+1}(\beta_1) + A_n q_n(\beta_1) + B_n q_{n-1}(\beta_1) = 0$$

3.  Conclusion
    
    The assumption that $\bar{p}_n(x)$ is a polynomial only guarantees that the coefficients $A_n$ and $B_n$ satisfy the interpolation condition at $\alpha_1$:
    
    $$p_{n+1}(\alpha_1) + A_n p_n(\alpha_1) + B_n p_{n-1}(\alpha_1) = 0$$
    
    Orthogonality requires $A_n$ and $B_n$ to also satisfy the independent pole condition at $\beta_1$. Since the claim does not establish that these constants satisfy both conditions, the polynomials do not necessarily form an orthogonal system.
    

Final Answer: FALSE.
