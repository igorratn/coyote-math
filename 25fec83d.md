Let $P_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x)$ denote the Jacobi polynomials, orthogonal on $[-1,1]$ with respect to $p(x)=(1-x)^\alpha(1+x)^\beta$. Let $Q_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}(z)$ be the corresponding functions of the second kind defined for $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus [-1,1]$ by:

$$Q_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}(z) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 \frac{P_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}(t)(1-t)^\alpha(1+t)^\beta}{z-t} dt$$

Consider the specific case $\alpha = \beta = 0$ (Legendre case), so $p(x)=1$. Define the sequence of functions:

$$f_n(z) = Q_n(z) P_{n+1}(z) - Q_{n+1}(z) P_n(z)$$

Claim: For all $n \ge 0$, the function $f_n(z)$ is a polynomial in $z$ of degree exactly $0$.

Determine whether this claim is True or False, and provide a rigorous proof.

Conclusion: True

Proof.

For $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus [-1, 1]$ we use the definition

$$Q_n(z) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 \frac{P_n(t)}{z - t} dt$$

to write

$$f_n(z) = Q_n(z) P_{n+1}(z) - Q_{n+1}(z) P_n(z)$$

$$f_n(z) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 \frac{P_n(t) P_{n+1}(z) - P_{n+1}(t) P_n(z)}{z - t} dt.$$

The polynomial in $z$ given by $P_{n+1}(z)P_n(t)-P_n(z)P_{n+1}(t)$ vanishes at $z=t$, hence is divisible by $z-t$. and the quotient

$$K_n(z, t) = \frac{P_{n+1}(z) P_n(t) - P_n(z) P_{n+1}(t)}{z - t}$$

is a polynomial in $z$ and $t$. By the Christoffel-Darboux formula for Legendre polynomials,

$$K_n(z, t) = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{k=0}^n (2k + 1) P_k(z) P_k(t).$$

Therefore

$$f_n(z) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 K_n(z, t) dt$$

$$f_n(z) = \frac{1}{2(n+1)} \sum_{k=0}^n (2k + 1) P_k(z) \int_{-1}^1 P_k(t) dt.$$

Now $\int_{-1}^1 P_0(t) dt = 2$ and $\int_{-1}^1 P_k(t) dt = 0$ for $k \ge 1$ by orthogonality against $P_0 \equiv 1$. Hence only the $k = 0$ term remains:

$$f_n(z) = \frac{1}{2(n+1)} \cdot (2(0) + 1) \cdot P_0(z) \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{n+1}.$$

Thus $f_n(z)$ is a polynomial of degree 0 (a constant), independent of $z$, for every $n \ge 0$.

Final answer: True.
