Let $\Theta(x)$ evolve under sineâ€“Gordon dynamics with $\Theta(0)=\tfrac{5\pi}{2}$. Determine $\Theta(+\infty)$, and present your answer as a multiple of $\pi$.

**Step 1.** The equilibria solve $\sin \Theta = 0$, so $\Theta = n\pi$. Linearizing $\Theta' = c \sin \Theta$ gives slope $f'(\Theta_*) = c \cos(n\pi)$. Stable points require $f' < 0$, so the stable equilibria are odd multiples of $\pi$.

**Step 2.** With $\Theta(0) = \frac{5\pi}{2} \in (2\pi, 3\pi)$ and $c > 0$, we have $\Theta' = c \sin \Theta > 0$ in this interval. Thus $\Theta(x)$ increases, cannot drop to $2\pi$, and must approach the attractor at $3\pi$.

**Final Answer.** $\Theta(+\infty) = 3\pi$.
