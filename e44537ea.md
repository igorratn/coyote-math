Let $d_{mm'}^\ell(\beta)$ denote the reduced Wigner d-functions for an irreducible representation of degree $\ell$ of the rotation group $SO(3)$. For fixed degree $\ell$ and magnetic quantum numbers $m$ and $m'$, the polar integral under the standard geometric measure is defined as:

$$I_{\ell m m'} = \int_{0}^{\pi} d_{mm'}^\ell(\beta) \sin\beta \, d\beta$$

Claim

For any fixed $\ell \ge 1$, the integral $I_{\ell m m'}$ is non-zero if and only if the difference between the magnetic quantum numbers $|m - m'|$ is an even integer.

Conclusion False

The reduced Wigner d-functions are expressed in terms of Jacobi polynomials as $d_{mm'}^\ell(\beta) = \xi_{mm'} P_n^{(\alpha, \beta)}(\cos\beta) (1-\cos\beta)^{\alpha/2} (1+\cos\beta)^{\beta/2}$, where $\alpha = |m-m'|$ and $\beta = |m+m'|$. Under the transformation $z = \cos\beta$, the differential measure $\sin\beta \, d\beta$ becomes $dz$, mapping the integral to the domain $z \in [-1, 1]$.

Consider the case $\ell = 1, m = 1, m' = 0$, where the index difference $|m - m'| = 1$ is an odd integer. The corresponding reduced d-function is $d_{10}^1(\beta) = -2^{-1/2} \sin\beta$. Substituting this into the integral yields:

$$I_{110} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin^2\beta \, d\beta = -\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{2}} \neq 0$$

The non-zero result for an odd index difference falsifies the "only if" condition, thereby disproving the claim.

Remark: The vanishing of the integral is not governed by the parity of $|m - m'|$ because the geometric measure $dz$ does not coincide with the orthogonality weight $(1-z)^\alpha(1+z)^\beta$ of the Jacobi polynomial factor.
