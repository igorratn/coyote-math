Let $d_{mm'}^\ell(\beta)$ be the reduced Wigner d-functions of degree $\ell$. For a fixed degree $\ell$ and fixed magnetic numbers $m$ and $m'$, consider the integral of the d-function over the polar domain:

$$I_{\ell mm'} = \int_{0}^{\pi} d_{mm'}^{\ell}(\beta) \sin(\beta) \, d\beta$$

Claim

For any fixed $\ell \geq 1$, the integral $I_{\ell mm'}$ is non-zero if and only if the difference between the magnetic quantum numbers $|m - m'|$ is an even integer, reflecting the parity conservation of the underlying Jacobi polynomials.

Question

Determine with rigorous proof whether the claim is False.

Proof - Consider the case $\ell = 1, m = 1$, and $m' = 0$. The difference between the magnetic quantum numbers is $|m - m'| = 1$, which is an odd integer. For these specific indices, the reduced Wigner d-function is defined as

$$d_{10}^1(\beta) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sin\beta$$

Substituting this expression into the definition of the integral $I_{\ell m m'}$ yields

$$I_{110} = \int_{0}^{\pi} \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sin\beta \right) \sin\beta \, d\beta = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin^2\beta \, d\beta$$

Using the integral identity $\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin^2\beta \, d\beta = \frac{\pi}{2}$, the value of the integral is found to be

$$I_{110} = -\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{2}}$$

Since $I_{110} \neq 0$ for an odd difference $|m - m'|$, the "only if" condition of the claim is violated. This specific counterexample demonstrates that the parity of the magnetic quantum number difference does not determine the vanishing of the integral under the geometric measure $\sin\beta \, d\beta$.
