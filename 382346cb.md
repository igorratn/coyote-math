The associated Legendre functions $P_\ell^m(x)$ on $[-1,1]$ can be expressed through the Rodrigues formula:

$$P_\ell^m(x) = \frac{(-1)^m}{2^\ell \ell!} (1-x^2)^{m/2} \frac{d^{\ell+m}}{dx^{\ell+m}}[(x^2-1)^\ell]$$

Consider points approaching the boundary: $x_\epsilon = 1 - \epsilon$ for small $\epsilon > 0$. Define:

$$Q_\ell^m(\epsilon) = \epsilon^{m/2} \cdot |P_\ell^m(x_\epsilon)|$$

Claim: For all $\ell \geq 1$, $m \geq 1$ with $m \leq \ell$, and all $\epsilon \in (0,1/2)$, the normalized quantity satisfies the uniform bound

$$Q_\ell^m(\epsilon) \leq C_m$$

where $C_m > 0$ depends only on $m$, not on $\ell$ or $\epsilon$.

Determine with rigorous proof whether the claim is True or False.

Answer: FALSE

Fix $m \geq 1$ and choose $\epsilon_0 = 1/4$, so $x_0 = 1 - \epsilon_0 = 3/4 = \cos\theta_0$ with $\theta_0 \in (0,\pi)$ fixed. Since $x_0$ is in the interior of $[-1,1]$, we can apply the standard interior asymptotic formula for associated Legendre functions. For fixed $m$ and fixed interior point $\theta_0 \in (0,\pi)$, the asymptotic expansion gives:

$$P_\ell^m(\cos\theta_0) = B(\theta_0,m) \ell^{m-1/2} \cos\bigl((\ell+\tfrac{1}{2})\theta_0 + \phi(\theta_0,m)\bigr) + O(\ell^{m-3/2})$$

where $B(\theta_0,m) > 0$ is a positive constant depending on $\theta_0$ and $m$.

Since the cosine oscillates, along an infinite subsequence of integers $\ell$ it is bounded below in absolute value by a positive constant. Therefore, for those $\ell$ and all sufficiently large $\ell$:

$$|P_\ell^m(x_0)| \geq c(\theta_0,m) \ell^{m-1/2}$$

for some positive constant $c(\theta_0,m) > 0$. Consequently:

$$Q_\ell^m(\epsilon_0) = \epsilon_0^{m/2} |P_\ell^m(1-\epsilon_0)| \geq \epsilon_0^{m/2} c(\theta_0,m) \ell^{m-1/2} \to \infty$$

as $\ell \to \infty$. Therefore, no constant $C_m$ can bound $Q_\ell^m(\epsilon)$ uniformly over all $\ell \geq 1$ and all $\epsilon \in (0,1/2)$. The claim is false.
