let $H_n(x)$ be the hermite polynomials, orthogonal on $(-\infty, \infty)$ with respect to the weight $e^{-x^2}$. let

$$d_n^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2} \bigl(H_n(x)\bigr)^2 \, dx$$

denote the $L^2$-normalization constant.

determine, with rigorous proof, whether for any fixed $A > 0$ there exists a constant $C_A > 0$ such that for all $n \ge 1$,

$$\sup_{x \in [-A, A]} \left| \frac{H_n(x)}{d_n} \right| \le C_A.$$


the statement is true.

fix $A > 0$ and set $x_1 = -A, x_2 = A$. by nikiforov and uvarov, special functions of mathematical physics (1988), chapter ii, § 7 (qualitative behavior and asymptotic properties), the remark on page 54 states that if $x \in [x_1, x_2]$, the inequality (28a) is a consequence of the more general bounds discussed. this inequality is explicitly given as:

$$\frac{|H_n(x)|}{d_n} \le \frac{C_3}{n^{1/4}}$$

where $C_3$ is a constant depending on $x_1, x_2$.

since $n \ge 1$, it follows that $n^{-1/4} \le 1$. therefore, for all $x \in [-A, A]$ and all $n \ge 1$:

$$\left| \frac{H_n(x)}{d_n} \right| \le \frac{C_3}{n^{1/4}} \le C_3.$$

by setting $C_A = C_3$, we have:

$$\sup_{x \in [-A, A]} \left| \frac{H_n(x)}{d_n} \right| \le C_A.$$

this shows that the orthonormal hermite polynomials are not only uniformly bounded on compact intervals but actually decay at a rate of $O(n^{-1/4})$ in the interior.
