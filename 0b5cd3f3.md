Let the small d-matrix elements $d_{m' m}^\ell(\beta)$ represent a rotation by an angle $\beta$ about the $y$-axis in the context of the $(2\ell+1)$-dimensional irreducible representation of the rotation group $SO(3)$.

Let $\psi$ be a normalized state in the $\ell=1$ subspace such that $\hat{L}_z \psi = 1 \cdot \psi$. In the standard basis $\{|\ell, m\rangle\}$, this condition identifies $\psi = |1, 1\rangle$ up to an arbitrary global phase.

Consider the rotated state $\psi_{\pi} = \hat{R}_y(\pi) \psi$, where $\hat{R}_y(\pi)$ denotes a finite rotation of $\pi$ radians about the $y$-axis. The action of this operator is defined by the transformation

$$\hat{R}_y(\beta) |\ell, m\rangle = \sum_{m'=-\ell}^{\ell} d_{m' m}^\ell(\beta) |\ell, m'\rangle$$

Claim: The rotated state $\psi_{\pi}$ satisfies the eigenvalue equation $\hat{L}_z \psi_{\pi} = 1 \cdot \psi_{\pi}$. Determine with rigorous proof whether the claim is True or False. 

Conclusion: False

The transformation of the angular momentum eigenstate $|1, 1\rangle$ under a rotation of $\pi$ radians about the $y$-axis is determined by the specific values of the Wigner small d-matrix elements. In the standard Condon-Shortley phase convention, these elements satisfy the general selection rule

$$d_{m' m}^\ell(\pi) = (-1)^{\ell + m} \delta_{m', -m}$$

For the parameters $\ell=1$ and $m=1$, the Kronecker delta $\delta_{m', -1}$ restricts the sum to the single component $m' = -1$. The corresponding phase factor is $(-1)^{1+1} = 1$. Consequently, the rotated state is given exactly by $\psi_{\pi} = |1, -1\rangle$.

The claim is tested by applying $\hat{L}_z$ to the rotated state. This yields the eigenvalue equation $\hat{L}_z |1, -1\rangle = -1 \cdot |1, -1\rangle$. Since the resulting eigenvalue is $-1$ rather than $1$, the claim is false.
