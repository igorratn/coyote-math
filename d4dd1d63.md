Let $\Theta_{lm}(x)$ denote the polar components of the spherical harmonics for integers $l \ge 1$ and $|m| \le l$. These functions are the bounded solutions to the associated Legendre differential equation on the interval $x \in (-1, 1)$. For a fixed $m$, these functions possess $l-m$ simple zeros within the open interval.

Claim:

For a fixed degree $l$, consider two azimuthal modes $m$ and $m+1$ (where $0 \le m < l$). The zeros of $\Theta_{l,m+1}(x)$ and $\Theta_{lm}(x)$ on the interval $(-1, 1)$ strictly interlace. That is, between any two consecutive zeros of $\Theta_{lm}(x)$, there exists exactly one zero of $\Theta_{l,m+1}(x)$.

Determine whether this claim is True or False, and provide a rigorous proof.


Conclusion: TRUE

The interior zeros of the associated Legendre functions are determined by the zeros of successive derivatives of the Legendre polynomial $P_l(x)$. By definition,

$$P_l^m(x) = (1-x^2)^{m/2} \frac{d^m}{dx^m} P_l(x)$$

Let $f_m(x) = \frac{d^m}{dx^m} P_l(x)$. On the open interval $(-1, 1)$, the factor $(1-x^2)^{m/2}$ is strictly positive and the normalization constant is nonzero. Therefore, the zeros of $\Theta_{lm}(x)$ in $(-1, 1)$ coincide exactly with the zeros of $f_m(x)$. In particular, since $\Theta_{lm}$ has $l-m$ simple zeros in $(-1, 1)$, the function $f_m$ also has $l-m$ simple zeros there.

Noting that $f_{m+1} = f_m'$, let $x_1 < x_2 < \dots < x_{l-m}$ denote the simple zeros of $f_m$ in $(-1, 1)$. By Rolle’s Theorem, $f_{m+1}$ has at least one zero in each open interval $(x_j, x_{j+1})$, for $j = 1, \dots, l-m-1$. Since $f_{m+1}$ is a polynomial of degree $l-m-1$, it cannot have more than $l-m-1$ real zeros. Hence it has exactly one zero in each interval $(x_j, x_{j+1})$ and no others.

This establishes that the zeros of $\Theta_{l,m+1}$ strictly interlace the zeros of $\Theta_{lm}$ on $(-1, 1)$.
