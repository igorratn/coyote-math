What is the hyperbolic area of the figure bounded by $OP$, $OQ$, and the curve $PQ$, inside the unit disk with the shown hyperbolic metric? Give your final answer as a rational multiple of $\pi$ in lowest terms.

Step 1. We are in the Poincaré disk, so Euclidean and hyperbolic angles coincide. The diameters $OP$ and $OQ$ meet orthogonally at $O$, so $\angle O=\tfrac{\pi}{2}$.

Step 2. By symmetry across $y=x$, the base angles are equal: $\angle P=\angle Q=\theta$.

Step 3. Let $P=(a,0)$ and $Q=(0,a)$. The orthogonality condition for the geodesic arc $PQ$ fixes $a^2=2-\sqrt{3}\approx0.52^2$.

Step 4. At $P$, the angle satisfies $\cos\theta=\dfrac{a^2+1}{2\sqrt{a^4+1}}$. Substituting $a^2=2-\sqrt{3}$ gives $\cos\theta=\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so $\theta=\tfrac{\pi}{6}$.

Step 5. The triangle angles are $\tfrac{\pi}{2},\tfrac{\pi}{6},\tfrac{\pi}{6}$. By Gauss–Bonnet in curvature $-1$, the area is $\pi-(\tfrac{\pi}{2}+\tfrac{\pi}{6}+\tfrac{\pi}{6})=\tfrac{\pi}{6}$.

Final Answer: $\tfrac{\pi}{6}$.
