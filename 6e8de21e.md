Fix a noninteger order $\nu$ with $\Re\nu > 0$. Let $u(z)$ be a solution of Bessel’s equation:

$$z^{2}u'' + zu' + (z^{2}-\nu^{2})u = 0$$

Assume $u$ is analytic in the cut plane $D = \mathbb{C} \setminus (-\infty, 0]$. Assume also that there exists a constant $C \neq 0$ such that, as $|z| \to \infty$, the asymptotic relation:

$$u(z) \sim C \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi z}} e^{i(z - \frac{\pi\nu}{2} - \frac{\pi}{4})}$$

holds uniformly on every closed subsector $\delta \le \arg z \le \pi - \delta$ with fixed $\delta \in (0, \pi/2)$.

Claim: Under these hypotheses one must have $u(z) = C H_\nu^{(1)}(z)$ for all $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus (-\infty, 0]$. Determine whether this claim is True or False, and give a rigorous proof of your conclusion.

----------

The claim is True.

Let $D = \mathbb{C} \setminus (-\infty, 0]$. Since $D$ is simply connected and the coefficients of Bessel’s equation are analytic on $D$, the space of solutions analytic on $D$ is two-dimensional. For noninteger $\nu$, the Hankel functions $H_\nu^{(1)}$ and $H_\nu^{(2)}$ are analytic on $D$ and have a Wronskian proportional to $1/z$, which is nonzero on $D$, hence they are linearly independent on $D$. Therefore, there exist constants $c_1, c_2$ such that:

$$u(z) = c_1 H_\nu^{(1)}(z) + c_2 H_\nu^{(2)}(z) \text{ on } D$$

On any closed subsector $\delta \le \arg z \le \pi - \delta$, the standard asymptotics give $H_\nu^{(1)}(z) \sim Q(z)$ and $H_\nu^{(2)}(z) \sim \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi z}} e^{-i(z - \frac{\pi\nu}{2} - \frac{\pi}{4})}$, where:

$$Q(z) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi z}} e^{i(z - \frac{\pi\nu}{2} - \frac{\pi}{4})}$$

To analyze the coefficient $c_2$, consider the ratio:

$$\frac{u(z)}{Q(z)} = c_1 \frac{H_\nu^{(1)}(z)}{Q(z)} + c_2 \frac{H_\nu^{(2)}(z)}{Q(z)}$$

In this sector $\Im z \ge |z| \sin \delta > 0$, the first ratio $\frac{H_\nu^{(1)}(z)}{Q(z)} \to 1$ uniformly. However, for the second term:

$$\left| \frac{H_\nu^{(2)}(z)}{Q(z)} \right| =  e^{2 \Im z} (1 + o(1)) \to \infty$$

uniformly as $|z| \to \infty$. If $c_2 \neq 0$, the ratio $u(z)/Q(z)$ would diverge, contradicting the hypothesis that $u(z) \sim C Q(z)$. Therefore, $c_2 = 0$.

Thus $u(z) = c_1 H_\nu^{(1)}(z)$ on $D$, and comparing with the asymptotic relation yields $c_1 = C$. Hence $u(z) = C H_\nu^{(1)}(z)$ throughout $D$.
