A spherical harmonic of order $\ell$, denoted by $Y_{\ell m}(\theta, \phi)$, is defined as a bounded single-valued solution to the angular part of the Laplace equation. These functions take the form

$Y_{\ell m}(\theta, \phi) = \Phi_m(\phi) \Theta_{\ell m}(\cos \theta)$

where $\Phi_m(\phi) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{im\phi}$ and $\Theta_{\ell m}(\cos \theta)$ is the normalized solution to the polar equation. A zonal spherical harmonic corresponds to the case $m = 0$, where the function is independent of the azimuthal angle $\phi$ and is proportional to the Legendre polynomial $P_\ell(\cos \theta)$:

$Y_{\ell 0}(\theta, \phi) = \sqrt{\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}} P_\ell(\cos \theta)$

For $\ell \ge 1$ and $\theta \in (0, \pi/2]$, we consider the function $g(\theta) = |Y_{\ell 0}(\theta, \phi)|$.

Claim

As $\theta$ increases from 0 toward $\pi/2$, the values of the successive local maxima of $g(\theta)$ form a strictly decreasing sequence.

Determine, with rigorous justification, whether the claim is true or false.

Conclusion: True.

Set $x = \cos \theta \in (0, 1]$ and $y(x) = P_\ell(x)$. The Legendre polynomial satisfies the differential equation $(1 - x^2) y'' - 2xy' + \ell(\ell + 1) y = 0$, which is a differential equation of hypergeometric type. In the notation of Nikiforov and Uvarov, Chapter 2, Section 7, we have $\sigma(x) = 1 - x^2$, $\tau(x) = -2x$, and $\lambda = \ell(\ell + 1) > 0$.

Following Nikiforov and Uvarov, Chapter 2, Section 7, Equation 5, we define the auxiliary function

$v(x) = [y(x)]^2 + \frac{\sigma(x)}{\lambda} [y'(x)]^2$

Nikiforov and Uvarov prove in Chapter 2, Section 7, Equation 6, that the derivative of this function is

$v'(x) = \frac{\sigma'(x) - 2\tau(x)}{\lambda} [y'(x)]^2$

In the present case, $\sigma'(x) = -2x$, hence $\sigma'(x) - 2\tau(x) = 2x$. Therefore, the derivative becomes

$v'(x) = \frac{2x}{\lambda} [y'(x)]^2$

For $x \in (0, 1)$, this expression is strictly positive whenever $y'(x) \neq 0$, so $v$ is a strictly increasing function of $x$. Between any two consecutive zeros of $y = P_\ell$, the function $y$ has constant sign, so the interior local maxima of $|y|$ occur exactly at the critical points of $y$. At such points $y' = 0$, hence by Equation 5 of Section 7, $v = y^2 = |y|^2$.

Ordering these critical points as $1 > x_1 > x_2 > \cdots > 0$, the monotonicity of $v$ gives $|y(x_1)| > |y(x_2)| > \cdots$. Since $x = \cos \theta$ decreases as $\theta$ increases on $(0, \pi/2]$, the successive local maxima of $|P_\ell(\cos \theta)|$, and hence of $g(\theta)$, strictly decrease as $\theta$ increases.
