Fix $\alpha,\beta>-1$. There exist constants $C>0$ and $\delta\in(0,1)$, independent of $n$, such that for all $n\ge0$, $$\sup_{x\in[-1,1]}\bigl|(1-x)^{\alpha/2+1/4+\delta}(1+x)^{\beta/2+1/4+\delta}P_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x)\bigr|\le C.$$ Determine, with rigorous proof, whether the statement is true or false.

The statement is true.

Proof

For fixed $\alpha, \beta > -1$, we invoke the uniform weighted bound for Jacobi polynomials from A.F. Nikiforov and V.B. Uvarov, Special Functions of Mathematical Physics, Birkhäuser, 1988, Chapter 2, Section 7, Eq.(20). Eq.(20) gives a uniform bound for the weighted Jacobi polynomials on [-1, 1], with a constant depending only on $\alpha, \beta$ and independent of $n$. There exists a constant $C_0 = C_0(\alpha, \beta) > 0$ such that for all $n \ge 0$ and all $x \in [-1, 1]$:

$$|(1-x)^{\alpha/2 + 1/4}(1+x)^{\beta/2 + 1/4} P_n^{(\alpha, \beta)}(x)| \le C_0$$

The expression in the statement can be factored as:

$$|(1-x)^{\alpha/2 + 1/4 + \delta} (1+x)^{\beta/2 + 1/4 + \delta} P_n^{(\alpha, \beta)}(x)| = (1-x^2)^\delta \cdot |(1-x)^{\alpha/2 + 1/4} (1+x)^{\beta/2 + 1/4} P_n^{(\alpha, \beta)}(x)|$$

For any $\delta > 0$ and $x \in [-1, 1]$, the function $f(x) = (1-x^2)^\delta$ satisfies:

$$0 \le (1-x^2)^\delta \le 1$$

This shows that the additional factor $(1-x^2)^\delta$ is bounded by 1 over the entire interval. By multiplying the uniform bound for the Jacobi polynomial by this factor bound, we obtain:

$$(1-x^2)^\delta \cdot |(1-x)^{\alpha/2 + 1/4} (1+x)^{\beta/2 + 1/4} P_n^{(\alpha, \beta)}(x)| \le 1 \cdot C_0 = C_0$$

Taking the supremum over $x \in [-1, 1]$:

$$\sup_{x \in [-1, 1]} |(1-x)^{\alpha/2 + 1/4 + \delta} (1+x)^{\beta/2 + 1/4 + \delta} P_n^{(\alpha, \beta)}(x)| \le C$$

where $C = C_0$. Since $C_0$ is independent of $n$, the statement is true.
