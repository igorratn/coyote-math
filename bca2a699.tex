On a surface of constant positive Gaussian curvature $K=2$, a geodesic circle of radius $r=\tfrac{1}{3}$ is traversed counterclockwise. A tangent vector is parallel-transported once completely around the circle. Compute the exact signed rotation angle in radians and report the final value as a decimal rounded to three digits.

Step 1. For a counterclockwise loop on a surface with constant positive curvature $K>0$, the signed holonomy is $\Delta\theta=-K\cdot\text{Area}$, and the geodesic disk area is $A=\tfrac{2\pi}{K}\bigl(1-\cos(\sqrt{K}\,r)\bigr)$.

Step 2. Substituting $K=2$ and $r=\tfrac{1}{3}$ gives $\Delta\theta=-2\pi\!\left(1-\cos\!\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\right)\approx -0.685$.

Final Answer: $-0.685$
