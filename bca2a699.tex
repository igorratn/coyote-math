In the attached image, the surface patch around point $P$ is smooth with constant positive Gaussian curvature. The small blue loop is a geodesic circle centered at $P$, traversed counterclockwise as seen in the image with the unit normal pointing toward the viewer. A black tangent vector at $Q$ is parallelâ€“transported once around this loop. Which colored vector is the correct result of the transport? Give your answer as a single letter.

Step 1. On a patch with constant positive curvature $K>0$, parallel transport once counterclockwise around a small geodesic loop rotates a vector slightly clockwise by an angle about $K \cdot \text{Area}$.

Step 2. Among the candidates, only the red vector  (A) represents a small clockwise turn from the original black one.

Final Answer: A
