In the attached image, the surface patch around point P is smooth with constant positive Gaussian curvature. The small blue loop is a geodesic circle centered at P. A black tangent vector at P is parallel–transported once counterclockwise around this loop. Four possible final vectors at P are shown in red, green, blue, and violet. Which colored vector is the correct result of the transport? Give your final answer as red, green, blue, or violet.


Step 1. The patch is locally convex, so curvature is positive. When you carry a tangent vector once counterclockwise around a small loop on such a surface, it comes back slightly rotated clockwise. The angle is small because the loop is small.

Step 2. That means the final arrow must be a small clockwise turn from the black one. No big swing, no opposite flip.

Step 3. Among the candidates:
red is a small clockwise turn → correct
green is a small counterclockwise turn → wrong
blue is a big counterclockwise turn → wrong
