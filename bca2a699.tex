In the attached image, the surface patch around point P is smooth with constant positive Gaussian curvature. The small blue loop is a geodesic circle centered at P. A black tangent vector at Q is parallelâ€“transported once counterclockwise (from the image's perspective) around this loop. Four possible final vectors at P are shown in red, green, blue, and purple. Which colored vector is the correct result of the transport? Give your final answer as red, green, blue, or purple.

Step 1. On a patch with constant positive curvature $K>0$, parallel transport once counterclockwise around a small geodesic loop rotates a vector slightly clockwise by an angle about $K \cdot \text{Area}$.

Step 2. Among the candidates, only the red vector  (A) represents a small clockwise turn from the original black one.

Final Answer: A
