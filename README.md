Mathematical task 16ab09af ... [[16ab09af.md]](https://github.com/igorratn/coyote-math/blob/main/16ab09af.md)

Consider the physicists’ Hermite polynomials $H_n(x)$ on $(-\infty,\infty)$ with $n\ge1$. For $z\in\mathbb C\setminus\mathbb R$, define $$Q_n(z)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-t^2}H_n(t)}{z-t}dt.$$ Claim. For every $n\ge1$,  ...
