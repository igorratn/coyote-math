Let $m$ be a fixed non-negative integer and $l \ge m+1$. The angular functions for the spherical harmonics are $$\Theta_{lm}(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2l+1}{2} \frac{(l-m)!}{(l+m)!}} P_l^m(x)$$  ... [[93f8b201.md]](https://github.com/igorratn/coyote-math/blob/main/93f8b201.md)

Let $d_{mm'}^\ell(\beta)$ denote the reduced Wigner D-function defined for degree $\ell$ and orders $m, m'$ with $|m|, |m'| \le \ell$. Define the bilinear form $B_\ell: \mathbb{R}^{2\ell+1} \times \mathbb{R}^{2\ell+1} \to \mathbb{R}$ by $$B_\ell(\mat ... [[842d9e3e.md]](https://github.com/igorratn/coyote-math/blob/main/842d9e3e.md)

Let $\Theta_{\ell m}(x)$ denote the normalized associated Legendre functions on $x\in[-1,1]$ for integers $\ell\ge m\ge0$, defined by $$\Theta_{\ell m}(x)=\sqrt{\frac{2\ell+1}{2}\frac{(\ell-m)!}{(\ell+m)!}}\,P_\ell^m(x),$$ where $P_\ell^m(x)$ are the ...

I have a file called all.md that contains multiple math problem entries, each identified by a header "### File: [filename].md". Please perform a comprehensive, fine-grained clustering of all problems found in the file based on their mathematical meth ...

The clustering output I provided was based on the complete content of the `<DOCUMENT filename="all.md">` section in your query, which contains exactly 33 unique problem files (as listed in my final summary). I double-verified the count by extracting  ... [[clusters_grok.md]](https://github.com/igorratn/coyote-math/blob/main/clusters_grok.md)
