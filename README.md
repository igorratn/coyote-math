A spherical harmonic of order $\ell$, denoted by $Y_{\ell m}(\theta, \phi)$, is defined as a bounded single-valued solution to the angular part of the Laplace equation. These functions take the form $Y_{\ell m}(\theta, \phi) = \Phi_m(\phi) \Theta_{\e ... [[16ab09af.md]](https://github.com/igorratn/coyote-math/blob/main/16ab09af.md)

I have a file called all.md that contains multiple math problem entries, each identified by a header "### File: [filename].md". Please perform a comprehensive, fine-grained clustering of all problems found in the file based on their mathematical meth ...
