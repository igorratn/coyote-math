Let $Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi)$ denote the standard spherical harmonics on $\mathbb{S}^2$, normalized in $L^2(\mathbb{S}^2)$, with integers $\ell \geq 0$ and $|m| \leq \ell$. The addition theorem for spherical harmonics states $$P_\ell(\cos\omega) = \f ... [[27ff7bd2.md]](https://github.com/igorratn/coyote-math/blob/main/27ff7bd2.md)

Let $D_{mm'}^{\ell}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ denote the Wigner D-functions (generalized spherical harmonics) which describe how spherical harmonics transform under rotations specified by Euler angles $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$. These functions can be facto ... [[339da8e1.md]](https://github.com/igorratn/coyote-math/blob/main/339da8e1.md)

A spherical harmonic of order $\ell$, denoted by $Y_{\ell m}(\theta, \phi)$, is defined as a bounded single-valued solution to the angular part of the Laplace equation. These functions take the form $Y_{\ell m}(\theta, \phi) = \Phi_m(\phi) \Theta_{\e ... [[16ab09af.md]](https://github.com/igorratn/coyote-math/blob/main/16ab09af.md)
