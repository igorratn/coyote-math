Here is the updated set of requirements I will follow for your problem creation tasks: * **Source**: Chapter 10 (Spherical Harmonics) from Nikiforov-Uvarov * **Type**: Reasoning-heavy (insight-based, not calculation-heavy)  ...

The spherical harmonics $Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi)$ satisfy three-term recurrence relations. One such relation connects harmonics of consecutive degree $\ell$ at fixed magnetic quantum number $m$: $$\cos\theta \cdot Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi) = A_{\ell m} ...

Let $Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi)$ denote the standard spherical harmonics on $\mathbb{S}^2$, normalized in $L^2(\mathbb{S}^2)$, with integers $\ell \geq 0$ and $|m| \leq \ell$. The addition theorem for spherical harmonics states $$P_\ell(\cos\omega) = \f ... [[27ff7bd2.md]](https://github.com/igorratn/coyote-math/blob/main/27ff7bd2.md)

Let $D_{mm'}^{\ell}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ denote the Wigner D-functions (generalized spherical harmonics) which describe how spherical harmonics transform under rotations specified by Euler angles $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$. These functions can be facto ... [[339da8e1.md]](https://github.com/igorratn/coyote-math/blob/main/339da8e1.md)

Here's an improved prompt that addresses the mistakes: --- I have a file called all.md that contains multiple math problem entries, each identified by a header "### File: [filename].md".  ... [[mk_cl.md]](https://github.com/igorratn/coyote-math/blob/main/mk_cl.md)
