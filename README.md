Let $u(r, \theta)$ be an axisymmetric harmonic function in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We propose an ansatz for a "modified" harmonic solution $\tilde{u}$ of the form: $$\tilde{u}(r, \theta) = r^n P_n(\cos \theta) + \alpha_n r^{n-1} P_{n-1}(\cos \theta)$$ where  ...

A spherical harmonic of order $\ell$, denoted by $Y_{\ell m}(\theta, \phi)$, is defined as a bounded single-valued solution to the angular part of the Laplace equation. These functions take the form $Y_{\ell m}(\theta, \phi) = \Phi_m(\phi) \Theta_{\e ... [[16ab09af.md]](https://github.com/igorratn/coyote-math/blob/main/16ab09af.md)

I have a file called all.md that contains multiple math problem entries, each identified by a header "### File: [filename].md". Please perform a comprehensive, fine-grained clustering of all problems found in the file based on their mathematical meth ...

Analyze the analytical patterns, citation styles, and structural layouts in `all.md`. When I provide a problem, identify the applicable category from these records and execute the response according to these strict rules: **1. Style and Format** * Fo ...
