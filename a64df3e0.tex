In the provided image, a flat torus is depicted using a rhombic fundamental domain with $60^\circ$ basis vectors. Point $P$ is marked, and several potential paths labeled $A, B, C, D, E$ are shown extending from $P$ to various lattice lifts of a point $Q$. The Voronoi diagram of the $Q$ lifts is also illustrated. Based on this diagram, which labeled path represents the longest path on the torus?

Step 1. On a flat torus, path length is just the Euclidean distance $ \|P-(Q+L)\| $ to a lift $Q+L$.

Step 2. In the image, $P$ lies on the Voronoi edge between $Q_{(0,1)}$ and $Q_{(0,-1)}$, so paths $B$ and $D$ are tied as the two nearest.

Step 3. Lifts $Q_{(-1,0)}$ and $Q_{(1,0)}$ (paths $A,C$) are farther, and the second-shell $Q_{(-1,-1)}$ (path $E$) is strictly farther still.

Final Answer: $E$.
