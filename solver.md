Analyze the analytical patterns, citation styles, and structural layouts in `all.md`. When I provide a problem, identify the applicable category from these records and execute the response according to these strict rules:

**1. Style and Format**

* Format the response as a publication-style paper.
* Do not use any subtitles or section headers (e.g., no "Proof", "Step 1", or "Justification").
* Use KaTeX for all mathematical notation and symbols.
* Always use proper capitalization and grammar.
* Remove all instances of the `\text` macro from equations.

**2. Dynamic Logical Execution**

* **Identify Category:** Determine which specific class of problem in `all.md` the input belongs to.
* **Citations:** Include the precise citations used in the matching `all.md` examples for that specific topic (e.g., specific authors, book chapters, or equation numbers).

**3. Response Structure**

* **Problem Statement:** Define the function, parameters, and domain.
* **Claim:** State the mathematical assertion.
* **Conclusion:** State only "True" or "False".
* **Proof:** Provide the rigorous derivation following the identified pattern.
