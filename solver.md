Here is the updated set of requirements I will follow for your problem creation tasks:

## **Problem Creation Requirements**

### **1. Problem Creation Goals:**

* **Source**: Chapter 10 (Spherical Harmonics) from Nikiforov-Uvarov
* **Type**: Reasoning-heavy (insight-based, not calculation-heavy)
* **Uniqueness**: Check against spherical harmonics problems in all.md
* **Coverage**: Systematically cover Chapter 10 topics
* Avoid identities that can be solved by direct substitution of standard formulas; the proof must require an analytical bridge between two or more mathematical properties.

### **2. Formatting Rules (from all.md pattern-matching):**

* **Publication-style paper format**
* **NO section headers** (no "Proof", "Step 1", "Solution", etc.)
* **KaTeX for all math** (proper `$...$` and `$$...$$`)
* **Proper capitalization and grammar**

### **3. Structure (strict order):**

1. **Problem Statement**: Define function, parameters, domain. Start with "**Let...**" and use double-line breaks between mathematical definitions for a "**spacy**" look.
2. **Claim**: State the mathematical assertion.
3. **Question**: State exactly: "**Determine with rigorous proof whether the claim is True or False.**"
4. **Conclusion**: State only "**Conclusion: True**" or "**Conclusion: False**".
5. **Proof**: Rigorous derivation (NO subtitles, flow naturally, drawing from the properties of functions in Chapter 10 and previous chapters).

### **4. Category Identification:**

* **Match existing category** from all.md (e.g., orthogonal polynomials, recurrence relations, integral transforms, Cauchy transforms, etc.) **OR** - **Propose new category** if the problem represents a novel pattern not present in all.md
* **Use matching citations** from similar problems in all.md in the format ``.
* **Follow the analytical style** of that category.

### **5. Solution Style:**

* **Neutral tone** (no "we", use passive or objective voice).
* **Concise** (no verbose explanations).
* **Natural flow** (one paragraph to next, no artificial breaks).
* **Rigorous** (complete logical chain).
* **No citations to the source book** in the problem statement or proof.
