In the attached image, the fundamental domain of a flat torus is drawn as a rhombus with opposite edges identified. At point $P$, an initial tangent vector (black arrow) is parallel–transported once around the solid loop.  Which labeled vector is the correct result of the transport? Give your final answer as a single letter.

Step 1. A flat torus is a Euclidean parallelogram with opposite edges identified. Its Levi–Civita connection is the Euclidean one, so the curvature is 0 and parallel transport in the universal cover (the plane) keeps vectors constant.

Step 2. Holonomy on a flat torus is trivial: transporting a vector around any closed loop projects from a constant vector in the cover, hence the vector returns to P unchanged in direction and length.

Step 3. In the figure, the only candidate that exactly matches the initial black arrow’s direction at P is label D.

Final Answer: D
