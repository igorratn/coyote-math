Let $u(r, \theta)$ be an axisymmetric harmonic function in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We propose an ansatz for a "modified" harmonic solution $\tilde{u}$ of the form:

$$\tilde{u}(r, \theta) = r^n P_n(\cos \theta) + \alpha_n r^{n-1} P_{n-1}(\cos \theta)$$

where $P_n$ are Legendre polynomials and $\alpha_n \neq 0$ is a constant. Suppose we require this $\tilde{u}$ to be orthogonal to the constant function $1$ over the unit sphere $S$ with respect to a modified weight $w(\theta) = \cos \theta$.

Claim:

For $n \geq 2$, there exists a non-zero $\alpha_n$ such that $\tilde{u}$ satisfies this modified orthogonality.

Determine with rigorous proof whether the claim is true.

Conclusion: False.

On the unit sphere $r=1$, the orthogonality condition with weight $\cos\theta$ is

$$\int_S \tilde u(1,\theta)\cos\theta\,dS=0$$

Using $dS=\sin\theta\,d\theta\,d\phi$ and $x=\cos\theta$, this reduces to

$$\int_{-1}^1 \bigl(P_n(x)+\alpha_nP_{n-1}(x)\bigr)x\,dx=0$$

Using the standard recurrence

$$xP_k(x)=\frac{k+1}{2k+1}P_{k+1}(x)+\frac{k}{2k+1}P_{k-1}(x)$$

and the fact that $\int_{-1}^1 P_m(x)\,dx=0$ for all $m\ge1$, we see that

$$\int_{-1}^1 xP_k(x)\,dx=0 \quad \text{for all } k\ge2$$

The only exception occurs at $k=1$, since $P_1(x)=x$, giving

$$\int_{-1}^1 xP_1(x)\,dx=\int_{-1}^1 x^2\,dx=\frac{2}{3}$$

Now apply this to the condition

$$\int_{-1}^1 xP_n(x)\,dx+\alpha_n\int_{-1}^1 xP_{n-1}(x)\,dx=0$$

If $n=2$, the first term vanishes but the second equals $\alpha_2(2/3)$, forcing $\alpha_2=0$, which is forbidden. If $n\ge3$, both integrals vanish automatically, so the condition is satisfied for any $\alpha_n$, including nonzero ones.

Therefore the obstruction occurs only at $n=2$. Since the claim asserts existence of a nonzero $\alpha_n$ for all $n\ge2$, it is false.
